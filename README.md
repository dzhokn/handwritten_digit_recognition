# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Backpropagation 1
In this project a simple `feedforward neural network` is developed from scratch (without `PyTorch` or `TensorFlow`). The project contains the code and data needed for training the neural network with `backpropagation` to recognize handwritten digits with 90% accuracy.

Better results could be achieved with:
 - different size of the hidden layer
 - extra activation functions (e.g. `softmax()` to be used on the final layer)
 - randomization of the training set

Feel free to play with these recommendations on your own. :)

NB: There is also one bug in the code, which does not affect the efficiency of the model at the moment.


## Backpropagation 2
Another `from scratch` model with different backprop implementation. It leads to 87% accuracy, but with higher number of iterations.
