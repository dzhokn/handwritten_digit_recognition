# Handwritten Digit Recognition
In this project a simple feedforward neural network is developed from scratch (without PyTorch or TensorFlow). The project contains the code and data needed for training the model to recognize handwritten digits with 90% accuracy.

Better results could be achieved with different size of the hidden layer and extra activation functions. Feel free to do that on your own. :)
