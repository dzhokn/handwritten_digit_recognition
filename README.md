# Handwritten Digit Recognition
In this project a simple `feedforward neural network` is developed from scratch (without `PyTorch` or `TensorFlow`). The project contains the code and data needed for training the neural network with `backpropagation` to recognize handwritten digits with 90% accuracy.

Better results could be achieved with:
 - different size of the hidden layer
 - extra activation functions (e.g. `softmax()` to be used on the final layer)
 - randomization of the training set

Feel free to play with these recommendations on your own. :)
